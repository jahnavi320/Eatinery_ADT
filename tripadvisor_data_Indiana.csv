The Spa center is well designed.  There is a change room with lockers and a shower.  You are provided with a robe to change.  From there you transition to the waiting room–this is well stocked with flavored water, tea and snacks to avail to.  I adhered to their no cell phone policy, but I found others using their phones in the waiting room[ which was a disappointment].  My Swedish massage itself was just okay.  My masseuse asked me whether any particular area needed more attention, and I mentioned about my back.  However, I found that it actually did not matter. More time was spent on my limbs than on my back.  I was amused when the masseuse mentioned that my back pain is related to from firm glutes.  Being a physician [and she knew I was one], I knew she was giving wrong information.  Firm gluteals will actually help with better back  [ and she mentioned that I may be climbing a lot of stairs, which I may do, so I don’t think she mistook it for tight glutes]. However, I did not say anything to her.  When it was time to leave, she mentioned that I should schedule another appointment to help for my  back and gluteals.

This is a eighteen hole (par 72) public course. The course is generally flat.  However, some holes do enjoy elevation changes. Not really any water hazards with which to contend.  They do have some bunkers, but these are not real problem on most holes.  The greens vary in size, but tend medium to small.  Further, most of the greens tend to be crowned, with the collars mowed close.  In other words, be careful of your shot placement to the green or you can roll back off, or down either size or the back. This can make what was a nice looking shot frustrating as you are chipping on rather than putting.  The strength of the course were the greens.  They were well maintained and fast, in spite of what I mentioned about their crowned design.  A weakness was the fairways.  Many of these were in need of repair and dried out.  The tee boxes (three choices - white, gold, red) were fine.  We have played here several times and like the design.

Ron Hopwood, owner and Wine Maker for Hopwood Cellars Winery, has been producing awesome wines since 1994. A trade​ he works to perfect, and continues to bring only the finest, award winning wines to the customer. When Hopwood Cellars Winery opened its doors on June 5, 2012, in Zionsville Indiana, it was quickly noticed by the consumer that these wines were not average, but are superior wines. Ron, with his wife Janet and a full staff, search out the best grapes from vineyards in Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. When asked what sets his great wines apart from others, ""I produce wines with a very strict regiment, with grapes sourced only from this region, local is very important"". What started out as a hobby, has grown very quickly into a large business that has definitive plans for future growth. Cheers! Ron started working out the details to open the winery. After much thought and research Ron and Janet found the perfect location. Hopwood Cellars Winery is located in the Village of Zionsville at 12 E Cedar St. Downtown Zionsville offers brick paved streets with a variety of wonderful shops, restaurants and galleries. You can park on the street and walk through the beautiful town, shopping or just sight seeing.

Sleep, and you will not sin. Avoid sin, and you will be saved. Ergo, drink wine and be saved.","The wine is not particularly good, and we tried a number of the wines.

First - the beach was great. We were here on a perfect hot summer day and had a great time. Not too crowded on a weekday, the water was nice if a little choppy (may have been wind). The beach was clean and relaxing. However, a couple other items made the visit less than ideal. We decided to do a hike first, then cool off at the beach. We took the covered bridge trail - a total mess. Honestly I've never seen a SP trail in this condition. It was covered with tree limbs, sticks, leaves and other litter making it hard to walk. There were no trail markers anywhere. The trail was sometimes difficult to follow as it was partially overgrown in areas. Had to go downhill at a narrow point, and I slid. My feet went out and I sat down hard! Ouch. We had to climb over large fallen trees a few times. The trail finally seemed to thin with no obvious end, so we just turned around rather than get lost. Not the best hike.  We left then and stopped at the campstore for snacks. It was pretty thin on snacks and drinks. Ok, but the man running the store was clearly a state park employee, most likely an asst mgr. He was clearly not happy to be assigned campstore duty for the day. He was surly and unfriendly, not what I'm used to at SPs. Whatever. Then we stopped at the pool so we could change into our suits for the beach. Were told we could not use the changing room unless we paid the $3 entrance fee. Seriously....so we finally found an actual restroom with plumbing, so we could change and wash up. (I think all the other toilets in the park are outhouses) This SP is not up to par with the others, probably not great management. It's worth a visit for the beach and the pool does look nice. But their website doesn't even talk about the beach! I had to google for info. There are other SPs nearby that are much better overall.",1157

Friends were in the area for an away weekend and decided to give this course a try.  The staff were pleasant and informative.  The course was not terribly busy and we were looking forward to fun.  Starter prepped us that they had just sprayed to kill the dandelions a couple days before we arrived.  As a result, white puffs balls were abundant.  These proved to be their own hazard, as leaving the fairway with an errant shot left you in six inch rough hunting your ball among the dandelions.  We managed to lose thirteen balls in the rough.  The course had an interesting layout with a mixture of easy and challenging holes.  The greens were not quite healed from being aerated and sanded in the Fall.  They putted a bit slow and not completely true.  For the most part we had fun, except for the long rough and abundant dandelions.  The only other negative was that we were stuck behind an extra slow foursome.  Front nine was 2 hr 45 minutes with nobody in front of the group in front of us.  They were kind enough to stop for food at the turn and let us past.  Our foursome played the back nine in 90 minutes with no waiting.  I suspect that by June the course will be in better shape.

VERY POORLY organized.  Let's start with the arrival into the parking lot - interesting!

Once into the parking lot there was a huge crowd of people just standing in the middle of the road, one guy appeared to be drinking moonshine. First thoughts before entering the building was, oh AWESOME WE ARE IN THE GHETTO!  I was immediately turned off and rather embarrassed for our guest to arrive.  Once in the building, it was loud and very unorganized, it took forever to get all the guest checked in and people were all over the place.  Our party room 1 was okay, a bit run down (holes in the wall) and dirty. Our hostess, well I'm not even sure we had one!  I recall being checked on ONE time other than that we were on our own! They certainly did not HOST THIS! They never announced or gathered the kids to come for food and gifts. Nor did they sing Happy Birthday.

The best part we saw was the 1933 World's Fair homes. The worst part was the fact that this part just is not up to the natural beauty we have seen at so many other national parks. It is scattered through many different areas. Some of the protected areas just don't seem that special: an old farm, a fur trapper's cabin/house, and some beaches. It used to be a national lakeshore, which honestly seems much more appropriate than national park designation. The park film is basically a 30 minute commercial for stuff you can do in the park (fishing, boating, beach, hiking, cross country skiing, birding, etc) with minimal information about the dune's formation or history. I can understand the desire to protect a very diverse ecological environment, but I really don't understand why this became a national park when most of it was already protected by its state park designation and/or previous national seashore designation. The staff at the Paul H. Douglas Center were great and very helpful. A few animals can be viewed there. This is currently on a road that is completely torn up for construction, but there are signs directing you to a parking area. The main visitor center in Porter, IN is not as helpful. A few random exhibits, the previously mentioned skippable park movie, and a large gift shop are there. Honestly, the main reason we went was to get the Junior Ranger badge for the kids. This involved watching the park movie, visiting both visitor's centers, seeing a beach, hiking the Dunes Succession trail (which is not clearly marked for the start at all...), visiting the farm, visiting the fur trapper cabin/house, and answering a few other questions. So we did spend like 4 hours ""in"" the park trying to accomplish all of that. I have zero plans to revisit this park, because there just is not much there in terms of natural beauty.",94

It lies at the north end of State Road 49 in Porter County, and includes more than three miles of beautiful beach along Lake Michigan’s southern shore. In the early 1900s scientists, recreationists and nature enthusiasts, recognizing the value and potential of the Indiana dunes area, fought to have the region preserved. As a result, in 1925, the state park was established.Large sand dunes, located beyond the entire shoreline, have taken thousands of years to form, and tower nearly 200 feet above Lake Michigan. A wide range of habitats and plant species are found in the park, with vegetation stabilizing some of the sand. These habitats provide homes for many types of plants and animals. The lake also provides habitat for many aquatic species, as well as a constantly changing fishery.Indiana Dunes State Park features a wide variety of habitats, including beach, sand dunes, black oak forest, wooded wetlands, and a button-bush marsh. Together, these areas contain some of the most diverse flora and fauna in the Midwest. Botanists from across the country enjoy studying the unusual collection of plant life. Other interesting features include “tree graveyards” (places where forests have been buried by sand and then, more recently, re-exposed by wind erosion). “Tree graveyards” can be seen in Big Blowout, near Trail 10. The Indiana Dunes area also is renowned throughout the Midwest for its birding. Visit the Nature Center to ask about good birding locations.Indiana Dunes State Park is surrounded by Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, a federally administered park comprising approximately 15,000 acres.",Wow!  I've lived in this general area all my life and had no idea there was so much to do and see.  I think you could spend a lifetime exploring and still not see everything.  Lots of educational programs too.  There's a lot more to the Dunes than the beach.,241

Each of our unique communities that host quilt gardens & murals has its own special character and fun finds you’ll want to explore.","My friend had always wanted to see the gardens, so we decided to take a road trip. Several of the gardens were beautiful; others seemed in dire need of water. One in particular looked like it had been abandoned after planting. The poor plants were begging to be watered. It seemed that the begonias and coleus were not having a good year which we know happens. Some of the gardens were difficult to locate, especially the ones that were part of a larger attraction. The patterns and color choices were beautiful. Overall, we’re glad we did it.  However, I would suggest visiting later in the season so the plants have time to mature.",428

We did not feel hurried at all and when I told her about our experience at Ruthsmere she has that look of ""yeah, I know the people there. Jennifer met us at the front door and welcomed us in and gave us a short but very informative talk about the history of Havilah House which dates back to the mid 1800 s. She then took us through each room of this immaculate home at our own pace which was wonderful. She did not try and hurry us at all and the furniture was not cordoned off as in Ruthsmere and you could even walk on the  rugs and get up close to the furniture, paintings etc. Not everything in the house is original but the decorating with the other pieces of the times were amazingly beautiful. I stood there just admiring the drapes and lace curtains. the amazing marble fireplace transported from Georgia and the light fixtures transported from places like Botswana and Italy. The men involved with these families were doctors and one of them was behind the Miles pharmaceutical company. These families were very wealthy and bought so much land in the 1800 s which is known as Elkhart, Indiana today and also established a flour mill and two other mills. At Ruthsmere they were the first family to have electricity which would only be on for three hours a day as the electricity river project was still underway. The owners of Havilah House had even signed their names on the brickwork of the house out the back which was incredible to see.  I loved the kitchen with the coffee grinder and butter churn and old stove. The 10 foot tall mahogany doors and walnut cabinets were immaculate as well as the ten  foot tall mirror were so amazing to see. Jennifer was a wonderful warm , friendly , informative host and made the tour at Havilah House well worth seeing. Thank you Jennifer !!!",1399

When we were finished we were informed we owed them 200+ dollars because of the tire that fell off. Their own flagman even stuck up for us to the mechanic stating we were driving cautiously and was a mechanical issue. We were then locked in the gates of the facility and not allowed to leave until the police officer arrived because obviously, we didn’t feel we was responsible for it. The North Liberty police officer got out of his truck being a complete jerk and obviously was a friend of this man that called him.

We are sorry to hear your kayaking experience at St. Patrick’s County Park did not meet your expectations. Ordinarily, all vessels would need to be off the river by 7pm, however, due to a special evening program that was using the kayaks, we needed them back by 5pm on that particular day. To let you and your companion know that rentals would need to be back earlier than normal, one of our staff stepped outside to alert you, but seeing that you were preoccupied and not wanting to interrupt, she spoke from a distance. This was not in any way meant to be yelling at you, and we’re sorry if that’s how it came across.  We understand that you planned this outing far in advance and wanted to take time to enjoy yourselves. The trip on the river takes about 1.5 hours and our staff wanted to make sure you had adequate time for transport to the launch site and paddling back to the park.  We apologize if you felt rushed, as our concern was making sure you were on the river by 3 pm to give you plenty of time to complete your trip before 5pm.  We have discussed how we could have communicated the early closure for rentals that day, including a post on our Facebook page, but we can’t guarantee that people will check that prior to heading to the park.  We don’t like to disappoint our visitors, however, we cannot always prevent it.  What we can do is make sure we provide friendly, courteous service and we’re sorry if that was missing during your visit. We will take steps to review that with our staff.  Since your post, one of our staff spoke to you by phone to discuss your concerns. We have extended a special invitation for you to come back and give our kayaking trip another try. 
Sincerely,
St. Joseph County Parks

At 10am, 1 window opened and then a second a few minutes later... there are 3 sled options, choose the lightweight 4 person regardless of your group size. The advantage of arriving early is your first run is almost instant, you can walk right up the steps and go. The ride is a rush! When you finish the quarter mile track and hike back, the line took about 20 minutes to get to the top again. The second run was more fun and we topped out at 36MPH. Walking back the line had grown substantially and I would estimate at a 30-40 minute wait...so we returned  our toboggan after 2 runs and it was exactly one hour. It was fun, if you can find a time when it's not crowded, it would be great... otherwise you're paying $20 per run because of the line.

Further the course layout is too fun, a mixture of straightforward and challenging holes with four sets of tees welcome players of all skill levels. Golfers will also find rates greatly affordable.

Upon entering, patrons go up a couple steps to the main level where the bar is located. Seating is available at the bar, at tables or on an outside deck overlooking the lake. We found the inside quite smoky. Yes, smoking is allowed. Further as this is basically just a bar - no kids. We elected sitting outside and watching boating activities on this bay of Lake Hamilton. We met a couple Hamilton locales on the deck.  They shared that Hamilton House Bar used to be a hopping place. They have the upper level where we were as well as a lower level, with a large patio. On summer days, they used to pack the venue with live bands on the lower patio.  They also used to be a place to go for a light meal, before they discontinued offering food. We were a bit surprised that on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, based upon their location and the views of the lake, that they were not busy. I suppose sad that they were not busier.

We strive to support local vendors, and give them a place to learn, expand, and be more successful in an urban environment. This will take time to find the right mix, so definitely give us a second chance -- things are always changing here :) ","This is a smaller version of the indoor markets that they have in Michigan and Wisconsin.  In total there are 6-7 small scale local shops that are a bit overpriced and a bit touristy. It's an adorable shopping area but imo I don't see the shops lasting to long if the overhead is big. I went with my girlfriends and we had a good time. Don't let this be the only thing that brings you downtown because at most you could eat up 2 hours, if that.  It was fun to see the local wares and meet the owners and hear their stories of how the business got started.

Our booking was from noon on and my husband received a phone call the day before confirming. Several co-workers were saying how happily jealous they were and how we needed to really take in the experience by relaxing in front of the fireplace with the complimentary wine. My boss even said make sure you get some because you’re paying for it LOL. We were so excited and couldn’t wait! When we arrived, I went to open the door but it wouldn’t open. Appearing to be stuck, my husband tried but it still wouldn’t open. We looked at each other joking that they were closed but then the door was opened by a person from inside who proceeded to give us the opposite of a welcoming attitude. We were smiling and smiled at her but she was visibly annoyed and said that the door was locked. She walked behind the podium and barely make eye contact. Well, given it was our first time there, we didn’t know that the door is kept locked so I would suggest guest services communicate this with new customers. This started the experience off on a sour note, which was a strike for me. We then were each taken to our respective changing rooms by two different employees who had print outs of our reservations and confirmed what we were receiving. We had arrived at noon and after receiving facials and massages, I decided to ask for a wine. I was told “we don’t have any.” I was confused and very disappointed. How could you run out of wine on Christmas eve? There’s even a liquor store in the same mall. That was another strike for me. We then proceeded to get our mani/pedis and sat side by side. We were laughing and having a nice time with the ladies. My husband’s tech forgot to put sandals on his feet so he had to be careful to not smudge them. They asked if we wanted to shower or go by the fireplace and we were both confused because we still had our manis coming. We said ‘No’ and went to go change thinking they wanted us to be dressed so we could just leave after the manis? It was awkward, we didn’t know if someone else was going to be doing our hands so my husband asked the front desk. They said they didn’t have us in the system for manicures. UM WHAT? They called and confirmed the day before and the employees who lead us to get changed READ what was on the PRINTED CONFIRMATIONS. We then realized what was going on. It was Christmas eve and they were closing early (our pedi techs said that we were their last two customers) so they took it upon themselves to cut us short. We spent A LOT of money and had been planning to start going to the spa on a monthly cadence, but that was the final strike for me.",2062

The appointment was at 12 and got there at 1145 and waited and at about 1205 they told me that Morgan the one scheduled to do my eyelashes was not going to be able to make the appointment time. I couldn’t believe it. I made arrangements for my kids and they waited until the appointment time to tell me that she wasn’t even there!! My time is just as valuable and I’m pretty sure if i cancelled without 24 hour notice they charge for the full appointment price! Terrible customer service and basically wasted my time. I live in auburn so not only my time but driving time as well. This is suppose to be a luxury spa experience. Hardly that!! Avoid Morgan as she doesn’t value your time!!!!,3318

Built of Bedford limestone in 1894-95, the building is in Romanesque Revival Style--a style that is share with several other courthouses in Indiana. Occupying a city block, there are a few war memorials and monuments outside the almost-square building. The basement is rather drab, but the first and second floors are practically period-pieces: tile floors, light oak wood doors and panels, including some original fireplaces and wooden desks; the walls of most rooms are decorated with faux period wallpaper; the hallways have gilded freezes. The court room on the second floor was  the setting for the so-called ""Pinto Trial"" in 1980, which eventually prompted auto-manufacturers to introduce ""recalls.""  Unfortunately, the county government is considering tearing down this vintage late 19th/early 20th century historic piece, so if you want to see it, do so soon.",907

She is quite knowledgeable about the Howard family and the steamboats.

You also learn the difference between keelboats & flatboats, and see beautiful views from the various rooms of the surrounding area.",41

It was around 1pm and the host was very nice, but after she seated me, I had to wait a good 15 minutes before anyone came to service me. I actually had to tell the hostess nobody had waited on me. I then ordered the Summer Salad with Blueberry Dressing and they brought it out with no strawberries on it. I then had to ask for them! The girl that waited on me was great (Devon) and very kind. I just wish others working in the restaurant were as hospitable. I felt totally ignored until I asked to be helped. The food was very good though and it was nice meeting Betty the owner.",410

Not only were there things to see/read outside, we were lured inside from the nice guy in the ticket booth (yes - a real booth) to see more.  The staff inside had ENORMOUS amounts of historical/interesting movie trivia/items based on the location and city, to see and hear about inside.  Lots of old movie posters, prints, props - etc.  Now... I asked the manager if I could just peek inside before the movie started... he kindly obliged, and I have to tell you - It just had that fantastic retro movie theater feel to it.  It was just amazing inside the actual theatre - soft lights, velvety chairs... it just seemed perfect!  Here is the best part - came back an hour later after an awful bbq lunch, and wanted to ""see"" the inside while a movie was playing (this IS a one screen theatre), again, the manager was very kind to let us take a look.  It was moviegoers heaven.  A bright screen, nice sound, but most important - it was PITCH BLACK in the theatre... literally couldn't see my hand in front of me if I was sitting in the dark.  Came back out and commented on this, and the manager told me that it's the way moviegoing should be! - and he is right!  Theaters now are so ""lit up"" during movies, that I feel like I could do surgery in them!  BUT... this tiny little theatre is in desperate need of $$$ to update the theatre to digital (much to my chagrin - much prefer film, but I'm old school...) - so, stop in and get some popcorn and just walk around soaking in the history and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE go and see a movie there the way it was supposed to be - you most certainly will NOT be disappointed!!",2380

Of particular interest here are the cup plates, canning jars, beverage containers, and bottle collections as well as the overhead Chandelier once owned by movie star Carole Lombard.

Of the 14 Models of cars manufactured in Richmond, IN we have 9 representations in our Car Wing.  There are only 2 privately owned Mummies in Indiana and they are both in Richmond, IN of which we have one that has been on display since we opened in August of 1929.  A quote from Bruce Sampsell, former President of Fisher Price Toys says it all; ""This gem of a Museum is like a NY Metropolitan, Smithsonian & Williamsburg all rolled into one.""","You find the most interesting things in places you don't expect to find them. Which is why my wife and I love to visit museums, any museums, wherever they are. Like the Wayne County Historical Museum in Richmond, Indiana. What would you expect to find here? Located at 1150 North A Street, in a historic eight-building complex that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the museum houses displays on the region's industrial heritage and early pioneer life. And it has been called ""a gem of a  museum that is like a miniature Smithsonian, New York Metropolitan and Williamsburg all rolled into one"" when describing the scope and quality of the museum's holdings. Open from 9:30 to 4 Tuesday through Friday and noon to 4 on Saturday, the museum was founded by wealthy society matron Julian Meek Gaar, whose extensive personal collection provided the impetus for future contributions, including a 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummy with its beautifully preserved and exquisitely painted coffin, cultural objects from Europe, Japan and the Middle East and an exhibit showcasing over 100 years of racing in Wayne County, from horses to ostriches to automobiles, from the Indianapolis 500 to NASCAR to Richmond, Dayton, Anderson and Winchester. Also a doll house built in 1880 for 10-year-old Caroline R. Jones with furnishings typical of the period. And a Richmond-built 1922 Pilot Speedster, one of 19 vintage cars on display. Perhaps most interesting of all is the exhibit on Gennett Records and its role in the history of jazz records and Richmond, known as the Birthplace of American Recorded Music. Not to mention the exhibit on William Wedekind of Hagerstown, Indiana, who was hailed as ""the world's greatest horseshoer"" after winning three medals at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago for his exhibit of horseshoes and horseshoeing.",322

But we discovered something we hadn't expected to find, the Joseph Moore Museum of Natural History. Located at 801 National Road West, it is a tribute to Joseph Moore, a teacher at the Friends Boarding School in Richmond (later to become Earlham College) who collected natural history objects to supplement his teaching. The museum opened in 1847 and was named in 1905 for Moore, who had risen to become a geology professor and Earlham's president. In 1889, the museum's reputation took off when Moore recovered the most most complete fossil example of the extinct Giant Beaver and acquired Ta'an, an Egyptian mummy, and the skeleton of Tippo Sahib, a local circus elephant that had gone mad and had to be shot. Today, the museum is a vibrant center on campus and among the largest employers of students. Open from 1 to 5 on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the museum is adjacent to Dennis Hall. Admission is free. It is divided into seven distinct and extensive collections--amphibians, anthropology, entomology, mammalogy, ornithology, reptiles and vertebrate paleontology. The herpetology collection includes 1,290 specimens, almost half from Indiana and surrounding area. It also contains reptiles and amphibians from 30 states and 19 countries. The ethnographic and archaeological collection includes everything from Babylonian tablets to Roman lamps, stone tools from local Native American mound sites and an authentic Egyptian mummy. It also includes over 2,000 objects from around the world, including Japan,Egypt, Africa and the Americas. The entomology collection features more than 30,000 specimens that document the insect biodiversity of the Greater Whitewater Valley. The mammalogy collection includes more then 4,000 specimens from 26 countries and 44 states, including almost 2,000 from Indiana. Of particular note is the museum's extensive collection of bats from around the world collected by Jim Cope. The ornithology or bird collection features over 6,500 individual specimens from 43 countries and four continents, including several Passenger Pigeons, a Harpy Eagle, an Ostrich and Whooping Cranes. The reptiles collection features snakes, iguanas and greenish lizards. Finally, the vertebate paleontology exhibit is highlighted by Moore's own discovery, the extinct Giant Beaver, which is displayed next to the remains of two mastodon skeletons, one discovered in Ohio in 1873 and the other in Indiana in the early 1890s. As someone who has admired the natural history exhibits at the Field Museum in Chicago for many years, a visit to the Joseph Moore Museum is a wonderment.",1586

There was no massage per se, rubbing areas on the client's body in a rapid up and down motion for 50 minutes does not equate to an actual massage.

So very sorry your visit was disappointing.  Our oven broke down on Oct. 5 and we have had a repairman come 4 times and each time we assumed the oven would be fixed.  Without going into all the details that the replacement part was broken, etc, etc. the fact is we should have posted it on our website.  We did have it posted on Facebook.  Our outdoor seating area was just removed this week and so I do not understand how it could have been closed when we have 3 tents with seating available on the property. I am sure an employee could have found you a comfortable seat outside upon request.  During these times with the inability to find employees and the inability to find supplies and their increased costs due to supply chain issues which are very real (our bottle costs are up 30%), I try to understand the issues other small businesses and especially restaurants are going through.  I, too, even knowing firsthand what other restaurants are going through, likewise get frustrated when my fast food restaurant down the way closes its dining room when I needed to use their restroom and they only had the drive-through open. And I have had many similar experiences at other restaurants, too.  Holly, I hope you can visit again and when we are not in the throes of outside forces impacting our operations as they have been since 2020.  Thank you for your compassion and your understanding and for taking the time to comment.","We visited Winzerwald on Friday October 28.We were very excited to try the restaurant for the first time. We drove 2 hours and arrived hungry, ready for lunch. To our disappointment we were told by the employee the kitchen had been closed for over a month. NOWHERE on the website does it mention this! The website raves about the flatbread pizza. The wine was fair and nothing to impressive. The outdoor seating area was closed. Which was also disappointing since it was a beautiful day in the mid 70’s temperature. Overall experience was disappointing. Not worth the 2 hours we drove to get there.

We have options in place that will allow anyone who faces a financial burden to visit to still come, including a family pass which can be checked out from any EVPL with a Evansville Library Card. Charging admission helps us keep up with the costs of running and maintaining of the trails, preserve and nature center and to fund the educational outreach programs and conservation efforts.   
The best deal for families is our Family Membership, which is only $40.  One benefit of membership is no admission fee for an entire year.  This spring, we opened our interactive interpretive center which will add to the quality of a visit. In 2017, we will be opening our Nature Playscape. This play area is unlike anything seen in this area. With a membership, you also get discounts on Canoe trips, camps, children & adult programming, free admission to many special events and discounts on others, and reciprocal memberships to Nature Centers across the country.

The result of this dream was the Artists’ Own Gallery. The gallery opened in 2000 on 3rd Street facing the Courthouse Square. The community embraced the opportunity to see and own great artwork. The success of the business led to relocating the gallery in 2002 to our present, larger location","Stopped by this double-wide storefront in downtown Lafayette recently.

Purdue University offers a unique golf experience in the Birck Boilermaker Golf Complex. The Kampen Course, a Pete Dye design, is an 18-hole, par-72 championship golf course featuring large bent-grass greens, fairways and tees. Located on the campus of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, the links-style layout presents a challenge for golfers of all abilities with vast sand bunkers, native grasslands, ponds and a natural bog. Kampen is rated one of the top collegiate courses in the nation and has been awarded 4.5 Stars on Golf Digest's ""Places to Play."" Kampen receives high marks as it is ranked as one of the most difficult golf courses in Indiana. The course has also played host to a number of prestigious collegiate and public tournaments such as the 2000 Men's Big Ten Championship, the 2003 Women's NCAA Championship, the 2004 Indiana Open, the 2005 Women's Western Amateur, and the 2008 Men's NCAA Championship. The course is named in honor of Emerson Kampen and his support of Purdue Athletics. Mr. Kampen's statue overlooks the first tee.","The Kampen course at the Birck Boilermaker golf complex is a wonderfully difficult golfing experience.  The course is well-maintained with big, fast greens and tons (repeat tons) of sand in both green side and fairway bunkers.  Those familiar with the architecture of Pete Dye will find plenty of hazards and bunkers to battle with.  Bring plenty of golf balls, because if the fescue is up, you'll be searching for a lot of your mishits. The golf plays to a variety of lengths due to the large number of tee boxes on each hole.  Be easy on yourself the first time and play the golds or whites.  Enjoying Kampen is an acquired taste, so please give it a 2nd time to enjoy and appreciate it even more.  ",3143

I just noticed your review of my business on Trip Advisor.  I really wish that you would have called me if there was a problem.  Would have been more than happy to have had a chance to correct the problem rather than see a review that I had no idea was out there until I just happened to be searching the internet and stumbled on it.  It is difficult to improve when you don't know about a situation.  I do apologize for having to label the Running Bear, it is very popular and we do everything by hand since we are a very small farm winery.  As for the sediment, some very dark red wines will have some sediment particularly over time as exposed to oxygen.  The sediment should not have any impact to the taste.  I just had a bottle of Kendall Jackson Merlot that had sediment in the bottom.  The Wine was awesome and as a winemaker I know how things work, sure some people would complain about the sediment that don't understand wine, but I didn't care the wine was fine.  We are a very small winery and attend lots of events so to describe us as a little unorganized and ill prepared for tasting guests I find very hard to believe.  My wife was the pourer and I find it difficult to believe she was not friendly or didn't ""crack"" a smile either.  The Desperado that we have flies off the shelf however maybe you just got a bad bottle.  I can count on 1 hand how many bad bottles I have had from people.  I always tell them thank you for coming back and make it up to them.  Sure things can happen.  Like I said earlier I wish you would have contacted me right away.  I would have shipped you new bottles on me and would still do it today.  I am not in business to disappoint people but to exceed your expectations.  Looks like we failed on your visit from your feedback.  My sincere apologies.  I can also count on 1 hand how many negative reviews we have received.  We just won medals with some of our different wines so I know we are doing something right.","Pulled up the entry (driveway to the house/barn) to the parking area that may fit 5-6 cars tight.

We are sorry that you understood our comment that way. Nothing was meant against your party with regards to the amount of people or size of people on the boat. When boat manufactures rate the boats' capacities, they use 150 lbs as an average per person, at the time the boat was manufactured. We were only expressing safety concerns for our customers for future rentals in regards to maximum occupancy for this specific boat. Our comment was purely for safety concerns and had nothing to do with discrimination. We're sorry if you misunderstood that as a non-diverse comment. 

Thank you for your input.
Best regards, 
Owner","Great place to rent a boat, The people who work here treat you like family. The prices are reasonable, The owner will accommodate you. and if you need a bluetooth ",2094

There is so much flat land around me that it is nice to see some height and views. This Nature Preserve is small enough and easy enough for most ages to roam. No guard rails by the rocks so watch the little ones but it's a nice place for a picnic with that special someone. There is also the bottoms at the base of black rock and if the stream is dry, you will be rewarded with many opportunities to find small flat rocks to skip on the Wabash. The name ""Wabash"" is an English spelling of the French name for the river, ""Ouabache"". French traders named the river after the Miami-Illinois word for the river, waapaahšiiki, meaning ""it shines white"", ""pure white"", or ""water over white stones"".The Miami name reflected the clarity of the river elsewhere but not here at Black Rock.
